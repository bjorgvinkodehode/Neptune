        <div class="item6"><p>Neptune is the eighth planet from the sun and has 14 known moons. Neptune’s largest moon Triton was discovered on October 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology. Prior to Voyager 2’s encounter, Neptune’s only known moons were Triton and Nereid. Scientists using powerful telescopes and spacecraft have since discovered a total of 14 moons orbiting this distant, giant world.

          Triton is Neptune’s largest moon and is the only large moon in our solar system that orbits in the opposite direction of its planet’s rotation―a retrograde orbit. It has a radius of 841 miles (1354km), making it Neptune’s largest moon. Triton is suspected to have been captured by Neptune, which would explain its highly unusual orbit and rotation. Scientists think Triton is a Kuiper Belt Object captured by Neptune’s gravity millions of years ago.

      Neptune’s other moons are much smaller than Triton. The second-largest moon, Proteus, has a diameter of only about 260 miles (418 kilometers). Proteus was discovered in 1989 by Voyager 2 spacecraft. The third-largest moon, Nereid, has a diameter of about 220 kilometers (137 miles) and was discovered in telescopic photographs more than a century later, in 1949.

  <div class="item6"><p>Neptune’s rings are also interesting. They are made up of billions of particles ranging in size from tiny dust grains to large boulders. The rings are believed to be relatively young compared to those around other planets in our solar system. They were probably formed when one or more of Neptune’s moons were shattered by cometary impacts or gravitational interactions with other moons.

    In conclusion, Neptune and its moons have been studied by scientists using powerful telescopes and spacecraft since their discovery. Triton is Neptune’s largest moon and is the only large moon in our solar system that orbits in the opposite direction of its planet’s rotation―a retrograde orbit. Proteus is Neptune’s second-largest moon while Nereid is the third-largest moon. Neptune’s rings are made up of billions of particles ranging in size from tiny dust grains to large boulders and they were probably formed when one or more of Neptune’s moons were shattered by cometary impacts or gravitational interactions with other moons.
