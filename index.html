      <h1 class="grid-col-span-3">Neptune</h1>
        <p class="grid-col-span-2">Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and was discovered in 1846. It was named for the Roman god of the sea. Neptune is dark, cold, and very windy². It's more than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth is. 
          Neptune is very similar to Uranus. It's made of a thick soup of water, ammonia, and methane over an Earth-sized solid center. Its atmosphere is made of hydrogen, helium, and methane.
          Neptune has at least 14 moons and six known narrow rings. Each of the myriad particles that constitute the rings can be considered a tiny moon in its own orbit.
          The four moons nearest the planet orbit within the ring system, where at least some of them may interact gravitationally with the ring particles, keeping them from spreading out.
          By far the largest of Neptune's moons is Triton, discovered by William Lassell on October 10, 1846, 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself.
          Over a century passed before the discovery of the second natural satellite, Nereid. Triton is almost as big as Earth’s Moon.
          The other known moons are Naiad, Thalassa, Despina, Galatea, Larissa, S/2004 N 1, Proteus, Halimede, Psamathe, Sao, Laomedeia and Neso³. The irregular moons are thought to have been captured asteroids or fragments of captured asteroids.
          Neptune has a system of rings made up largely of dust-size particles. The rings are difficult to see because they are dark and vary in density.
